C3350 Iteration 2 Retrospective

Things that went well:
* Communication through Discord, both generally and in passing work between each other as needed
* Organization of dev tasks using Trello
* Planning, particularly making time commitments for working hours

Things that went less well:
* Git branch organization devolved halfway through the iteration into everybody working on one big branch
* A more thorough approval process
* Planning of user stories before planning dev tasks
* Distribution of labour

Goal: A more strict, thorough code approval process
A concrete measure of our success toward this goal will be the presence of smaller branches, and more branches.
